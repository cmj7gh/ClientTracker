Purpose:

This student tracking database is a custom-built database and website front-end that allows Program Officers and staff to track youth involvement in programs, interactions with youth after they graduate high school, and services provide to youth outside of the standard programs. 
The website’s key features include adding/editing information in the database and reporting summary statistics on student performance.
